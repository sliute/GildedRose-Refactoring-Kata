# Gilded Rose Tech Test

This repo is forked from [here](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata). I worked on its __JavaScript__ version.

This Kata was originally created by Terry Hughes (http://twitter.com/#!/TerryHughes). It is already on GitHub [here](https://github.com/NotMyself/GildedRose). See also [Bobby Johnson's description of the kata](http://iamnotmyself.com/2011/02/13/refactor-this-the-gilded-rose-kata/).

## How to Deploy and Test

```
$ git clone https://github.com/sliute/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata.git
$ cd GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/js
$ open SpecRunner.html
```
You'll want to look at the ["Gilded Rose Requirements"](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/tree/master/GildedRoseRequirements.txt), which explain what the code is for.

## Progress and Issues

* Written test suite for all above requirements.
* TDD-ed the introduction of 'Conjured' items, without refactoring the existing codebase (only added minimal amount of code to it).
